# learning-switch
Project modified by Santiago Sarmiento Sotomayor 
August 2019

The learning switch project has been modified to add the functionality of routing multicast traffic under the analysis of IGMP packets sent by client nodes.
A base rule must be added to the switch to send all IGMP packets to the OpenDaylight controller.

# HOW TO BUILD
In order to build it's required to have JDK 1.8+ and Maven 3.2+. 
The following commands are used to build and run.
```
$ mvn clean install
$ cd distribution/opendaylight-karaf/target/assembly
$ ./bin/karaf
karaf>feature:install sdnhub-XYZ
```
